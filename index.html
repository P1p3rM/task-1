        <p2> Minecraft was a big part of my childhood and i still play it regularly to this day, so of course it was one of the first options that came to mind. I have always loved being able to build whatever structure i like and being able to stretch my creativity to be able to work with the given blocks.</p2>

        <p>Minecraft is an open world game where you run around creating anything you want and collecting food/resouces. To 'complete' the game you go to a realm called the end and fight the dragon. It is a cube based game so no circles exist inside the game. Minecraft is availabe on pretty much any device and is a fun game for all ages, with slight voilence but tollerable for younger ages. </p>
